	Our mission is simple: help make the world a better place by providing quality t-shirts to children in need. With our 'one for one' model, every t-shirt bought is a t-shirt donated to a child in poverty somewhere across the globe. 
	<p> 
In 2009, founder Alex Cruz visited India after graduating college, and was forever changed by what he saw there. Never before had he seen so many with so little, especially those most vulnerable, and never before had an opportunity for great change been more apparent. With his mind set on helping provide for those in poverty, he began thinking about ways to positively impact as many people as he could. He then realized that clothing was the way to go. With low manufacturing costs, Alex figured out that he could profit enough off of selling quality t-shirts to then manufacture free ones for children in need. 
	<p> 
And 13 Years later, Highland T-Shirts is proud to be able to make t-shirts for those who seek to make a difference.
